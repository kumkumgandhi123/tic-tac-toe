# tic-tac-toe
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game using Python programming language. Beginners can use this as a small project to boost their programming skills and understanding of logic.
1.	The Tic Tac Toe is a pen-and-paper game, usually played between two people, in which each player alternately places a cross or zero in the nine spaces of the grid. 

2.	The Game: Here the crosses and zeros are placed alternately by the players and the first one to complete the pattern of 3 wins the game.

3.	A simultaneous, three-pair game, has three possible outcomes: a win, a draw, and a loss. It is a good game for testing the presence of mind between two players.

4.	For convenience, we have given multiple chances. For example, the project that I have built has an infinite number of chances unless the user wants to quit.
